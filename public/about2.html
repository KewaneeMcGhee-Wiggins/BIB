    <h1> Breast Is Best Donation Center Of Greater Boston MA </h1>
  </div>
   <p> Denise's Story:
    My first daughter just couldn’t wait to be born, and I went into pre-term labor with her at 32 weeks. Thankfully, my
    doctor managed to stop my labor, and after seven weeks of bed rest, she was born full-term. If she’d been born
    early, she would have spent time in the NICU, and I know I would have been desperate to do whatever I could to give
    her the best possible chance at health. I’d read about breastmilk donation and milk banks, and when I did some
    Googling I found the Breast Is Best Donation Center of Greater Boston , which accepts donated breastmilk and
    provides it to hospitals for use in the NICU or the nursery. Outpatients can also receive donor milk via
    prescription. The Milk Bank is located in Boston, about 15 minutes from my house. After playing some phone tag, I
    spoke to one of their lactation consultants, who explained the milk donation process to me. There was also a website
    I could connect with other donators and clients to find a potential match.</p>

    <h2>Prior to donation</h2>
  <p>  First, potential donors answer a few questions about their health and habits over the phone. Next, donors fill out
    some paperwork, including another survey about health and habits. If you pass these initial screenings, you can
    start pumping and freezing! Donors need to commit to a minimum milk donation of 100 ounces, but the Breast Is Best
    Donation Center of Greater Boston, prefers 150. When you are close to the minimum number of ounces required, you
    have to get a blood test. The Milk Bank sends you the kit in the mail, you get the blood drawn, and you mail it
    back. The results come in after about two business days, and then, if you pass, you can bring in your donation!</p>

    <h2>Slow and steady</h2>
    <p>Because I’d been quick to pump those 22 ounces, I thought getting to 100 would be a breeze. The Mothers’ Milk Bank
    Northeast emphasizes that you have to feed your own baby first. So I would pump at night, right before I went to
    bed, getting at least three to four ounces and closer to five ounces on a really good night. But sometimes I’d
    forget about pumping and was just too tired when I finally remembered. Then I got an ear infection and couldn’t
    donate during my course of antibiotics, and for three days after. Then it was Passover, and I drank the (required!)
    glasses of wine. And you can’t pump milk for donation for 24 hours after consuming any alcohol.</p>

    <h2>Getting into a routine </h2>
   <p> After a few hiccups (and swapping the batteries in my breast pump), I was getting four to five ounces of breastmilk
    every night. I’d mark the bags with the date and stick them in the freezer. (Milk can be stored for three months in
    a refrigerator/freezer, or for six months in a standalone freezer before taking it in as a donation.) I learned the
    hard way that it’s a good idea to record ounces pumped each night and keep a running total of milk volume. We had to
    eat the frozen salmon burgers, french fries, and two boxes of Trader Joe’s molten chocolate macarons in order to
    make room for more breastmilk!</p>

   <h2> Donating breastmilk - Breast Is Best of Greater Boston, MA</h2>

    It took me about 10 weeks to pump the required amount of milk. After getting the results of my blood test, I brought
    164 ounces of breastmilk to the Mothers’ Milk Bank Northeast. Both of my daughters came with me, and we watched as
    they processed and pasteurized milk that had come in from other donors. I don’t particularly enjoy pumping. I don’t
    like washing the bottles and the pump parts with all of their tiny crevices. But it’s a wonderful feeling to know
    you’ve had a hand in giving a teeny tiny baby his or her best possible chance at health. So if you’ll excuse me, I
    have a date with my breast pump.
