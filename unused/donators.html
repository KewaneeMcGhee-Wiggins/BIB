    <h3>Four easy steps to donate breast milk:
        <ol>
            <li>Complete a 15-minute phone screening.</li>
            <li> Fill out forms.</li>
            <li> Get a blood test (we pay for it).</li>
            <li> Make arrangements with us for delivery of your breast milk (at no cost to you).</li>
            Our screening usually takes 2 – 3 weeks to complete. (We can do the screening in English, Spanish,
            Portuguese or Creole).<ol>
